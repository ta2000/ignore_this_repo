Replacing parts of init2 (my first Vulkan project which had messy code) with cave\_explorer\_2 (which was meant to be a
cleanup of init 2 but doesn't work) until the code is both less messy and
functional.


If you want to build and run it use the compile\_run script and hope it works
for you. You can probably tell I don't know what I'm doing with bash scripts.
